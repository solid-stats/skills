# Correctness & quality

The design, correctness, security, and quality rules — full translation of the SolidStats backend
doctrine to TypeScript / Fastify. These are **conventions** (what good code does). The
`solidstats-backend-ts-code-review` skill turns each into a hunt with an evidence gate and a
severity; the severity each maps to is noted in brackets so the two skills agree.

---

## External HTTP adapters

External calls (Steam, other services) go through an adapter with a strict error taxonomy.

- The HTTP client is created once and injected (a plugin-provided singleton), **never** constructed
  per request.
- **Connection / network failure → an infrastructure error on our side** (a domain-style `AppError`,
  e.g. `UpstreamUnreachable`, 502). **An upstream non-2xx response → `ExternalServiceError`.** Keep
  the two distinct — callers use the taxonomy to tell "we couldn't reach them" from "they returned an
  error". [🔴 if conflated and it breaks the contract; otherwise 🟠]
- Auth headers are built by a helper, not assembled inline per call.
- The response status is checked explicitly; the upstream status code (and a body snippet on error)
  is logged before raising (see §AA).

---

## Async safety

The event loop is single-threaded; blocking it freezes every concurrent request.

- **No blocking I/O inside `async` paths** — no sync `fs` reads, no sync hashing of large input on
  the request path. Use the async API or offload to a worker. [🟠 — 🔴 when it stalls a hot/shared path]
- **No N+1** — no `await` on a per-item repo/service call inside a loop over a collection; batch into
  one query. [🟠]
  ```ts
  // VIOLATION — one query per item
  for (const m of medias) await repo.getDetail(m.id);
  // CORRECT — one batch query
  await repo.getDetails(medias.map((m) => m.id));
  ```
- Independent async operations run concurrently (`Promise.all` / `allSettled`), not awaited one by
  one in a loop.
- **No floating promises** (enforced by `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`): every promise is
  awaited or explicitly handled. [🟠]
- External I/O has a timeout; long cancellable work threads an `AbortSignal`.

---

## Security depth

- **IDOR — ownership/permission check.** Any endpoint that takes an entity id and reads or modifies
  that entity must have a visible ownership or role/permission check somewhere in the
  controller → usecase → service chain. Missing check is the single worst defect here. [🔴 BLOCK]
  ```ts
  if (appeal.ownerSteamId64 !== req.user.steamId64) throw new errors.AccessDenied({ id });
  ```
- **Mass assignment.** `XCreate` / `XUpdate` schemas must not accept server-assigned fields —
  the owner's `steamId64`, `role`, `isAdmin`, `isActive`, or a status only the server may set. A
  privileged field in a request body schema is a finding. [🟠]
- Authorization is enforced **server-side**, never assumed from the client.
- No hardcoded secrets (see `schemas-and-data.md` → Config); secrets never logged.

---

## Security & runtime hardening

A backend owning Steam OAuth, moderation, and money-like bounty data needs HTTP/process hardening
beyond input validation:

- **Rate limiting** — `@fastify/rate-limit`: a global baseline plus stricter limits on auth/login and
  bounty/moderation mutation routes (OWASP API4/API2 — brute-force + resource exhaustion). [🔴 on
  auth/mutation routes, else 🟠]
- **Security headers + CORS** — `@fastify/helmet` (HSTS/CSP/frame options) and an explicit
  `@fastify/cors` **allow-list** (the `web` origin only; credentials handled deliberately). Permissive
  CORS on a credentialed API is an account-takeover vector. [🔴]
- **Body/payload limits** — set `bodyLimit` globally and per-route (uploads); a schema `maxLength`
  doesn't stop a multi-MB body from being parsed first. [🟠]
- **Graceful shutdown** — on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, `await app.close()` to drain in-flight requests and
  close DB/queue/consumers, with a forced-exit timeout; consider `@fastify/under-pressure` for 503 on
  overload. Per-resource `onClose` alone doesn't drain HTTP. [🟠]
- **Auth & session** — verify the Steam OAuth `state` (CSRF) on callback; session cookies are
  `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite`; sessions expire/rotate; cookie-auth mutations carry CSRF
  protection. [🟠]
- **Secrets in responses** — never in error `details`/responses, logs, or OpenAPI examples; env-only
  and rotatable. [🔵]

## Queue reliability

The durable `parse_jobs` claim (SKILL §A) requires consumer discipline:

- **Manual ack** (no auto-ack) so a crash mid-process redelivers rather than loses the job; bound
  in-flight work with a **prefetch/QoS** cap. [🟠]
- **Dead-letter + poison cap** — a message that always fails routes to a DLQ (or hits a delivery-count
  cap) instead of requeuing forever. [🟠]
- **Idempotent writes** — money-like / duplicate-sensitive mutations (bounty grants, moderation
  actions) accept an `Idempotency-Key` (or dedupe on a natural key) so a client retry can't
  double-apply. [🟠]

---

## Contract compliance (LSP)

A factory that implements a contract must honor it exactly — the type system catches most of this,
so the rule is mostly "don't defeat the checker":

- No `as`-cast to force a value to satisfy a contract; no `@ts-expect-error` to silence a real
  mismatch.
- Don't widen a contract's return (`T` → `T | undefined`) or add required parameters callers of the
  contract can't supply. [🔴 if it breaks callers]
- Errors thrown are a subset of what the contract documents — no surprise new error types leaking out
  of an implementation.

---

## SOLID — function/factory level

- **SRP.** No function longer than ~40 lines — a long function is doing more than one thing; split
  into named helpers. [🟡] No factory with more than ~5 **non-structural** dependencies (structural
  deps — `db`, `logger`, `config`, `errors` — don't count). [🟡]
- **OCP.** No `if/else if` chain dispatching on a status/type union with more than 3 branches in a
  service/usecase — every new variant forces editing existing code. Use a typed map. [🟡]
  ```ts
  const FEE: Record<PlanType, number> = { basic: 0.10, pro: 0.08, enterprise: 0.05 };
  ```

## DRY — rule of three

- The **same logic** (not merely a similar shape) repeated 3+ times within a module is extracted.
  Similar-looking code across different entities is acceptable — extract only when the logic itself
  is truly duplicated. [🟡]

## Schema quality

- Request-body strings/arrays without `maxLength`/`maxItems`, or bounded-domain numbers without
  `minimum`/`maximum`, are findings (DoS surface). [🟡]
- Business rules belong in the service as typed errors, not jammed into schema keywords (see
  `schemas-and-data.md`). [🟡]

---

## §Z. Observability — log hygiene

Structured logging via pino is the operational interface. This section keeps logs *hygienic*; §AA
is about whether they're *diagnosable*.

- **Structured only** — `log.info({ replayId, jobId }, 'msg')`, never string concatenation.
  Correlate by `jobId` / `replayId` so a parse flow is followable end to end. [🟡 on concat]
- **Log levels mean things** — `warn` = an unexpected state needing attention; `debug` = an expected
  code path. A routine "not found" in a get-or-null lookup is `debug`, not `warn`. [🟡 on misuse —
  evidence gate: `log.warn` inside an `if (!entity)` for a routine fetch]
- **State transitions are logged** — a method that changes an entity's status/lifecycle
  (`changeStatus`, `revoke`, `approve`, `reject`, anything named `*status*`/`*transition*`) contains
  at least one log line recording the transition. [🟡 if absent — evidence gate: name matches, zero
  `log.*` in the body]
- **No PII / secrets, no whole objects** — log the identifier (`id`, `steamId64`), not the full
  row/payload; redact auth/password/token/secret. [🟡 — evidence gate: a full row/schema passed as a
  log field]
- Expose `prom-client` metrics for the operational surface: queue depth, job results, parser
  failures, API/DB health; plus `/health` (+ detailed checks).

---

## §AA. Log diagnosability

§Z keeps logs hygienic; §AA is the operational question: **when this code misbehaves in staging or
production, do the logs alone let you follow the normal flow and pinpoint what failed and why** —
without re-running it under a debugger? Treat detailed, diagnosable logging as a first-class
feature: reading a method and its future log stream should let you reconstruct both how it worked
and where it broke.

Two guardrails keep this from fighting the rest of the skill or turning into noise:

- **Never tell the developer to *add* a `try/catch`.** The layer rules forbid defensive `try/catch`
  around service/usecase calls. §AA applies only to error paths that **already exist** — an existing
  `catch`, or an `if`-guard that raises or returns an error — and to genuine flow inflection points.
  Demanding a new `try/catch` "for logging" is a layering violation, not a §AA finding.
- **The boundary is already logged.** Fastify logs each request via `req.log`, and the central
  `setErrorHandler` logs every error that propagates to it. Do **not** flag a method for "no logs"
  when the request logger / error handler already covers it, and do **not** demand an inner log
  before a bare `throw`/re-throw — the handler records the propagating error. §AA targets only what
  the boundary cannot see: which branch ran, *why* an error was raised, and errors **swallowed before
  they ever reach the boundary**.

**Swallowed errors — silent `catch` / silent error branch [🟠]:** a `catch` must not both fail to
log **and** fail to re-throw. Silently degrading (returning a default/`undefined`) with no trace is
the worst case for diagnosability — the failure vanishes and a later, unrelated symptom is all you
get.
```ts
// VIOLATION — failure disappears: nothing logged, nothing re-thrown
try { payload = JSON.parse(raw); } catch { payload = {}; }

// CORRECT — record why before degrading
try { payload = JSON.parse(raw); }
catch (err) { req.log.warn({ err, replayId }, 'malformed payload, defaulting to empty'); payload = {}; }
```
Evidence gate: a `catch` block with zero `log.*` calls and no re-throw. A bare re-throw on its own
is fine (the handler logs it).

**Traceback preserved on logged exceptions [🟡]:** when you log inside a `catch`, pass the **error
object** (`log.error({ err }, 'msg')`) — pino serializes the stack. Logging only `err.message`
discards the trace, which is usually the most useful line. Preserve `cause` when re-wrapping.
Evidence gate: a `log.error/warn` inside a `catch` that references the error but logs only its
message/string, not `{ err }`.

**Identifying context in errors [🟡]:** an error raised or logged from a branch that *has* an
identifier in scope must carry it — the entity `id`, the `steamId64`, or the offending value — via
`details` on the error or as a structured log field. An error with no identifier can't be tied to a
request in production.
```ts
// WEAK — which appeal? which user? unanswerable from the log
throw new errors.InvalidStatusTransition();
// CORRECT — details pin it to one entity and one bad transition
throw new errors.InvalidStatusTransition({ id, from: current, to: next });
```
Evidence gate: an error raised/logged from a branch with an identifying value in scope that passes
neither `details` nor logs that value. Don't flag generic guards with no identifier in scope; and
`details` must add context, not duplicate the static `message`.

**Upstream failures are diagnosable [🟡]:** when an external HTTP call fails, the log on that path
captures enough to tell whether it was *us* or *them* — the upstream **status code** and, for an
error response, a **body snippet** — before raising. (§External adapters owns the exception
taxonomy; §AA adds only that the failure is logged with upstream detail, so a dependency's 5xx storm
is visible in your own logs.)
```ts
req.log.warn({ url, status: res.status, body: (await res.text()).slice(0, 500) }, 'upstream error');
throw new ExternalServiceError({ url, status: res.status });
```
Evidence gate: an external-adapter path that handles a non-2xx / raises `ExternalServiceError` where
neither the status code nor a body snippet is logged anywhere on that path.

**Happy-path flow is legible [🔵]:** beyond the request log the boundary already emits, the
meaningful *decisions* a method makes should be followable — which arm of a business conditional
ran, that an external call was issued, that an item was skipped vs processed in a loop. One
`debug`/`info` line at each real inflection point. Apply **sparingly**: don't flag trivial guards,
getters, or one-line conditionals.
```ts
if (plan.isTrial && plan.expiresAt < now) log.info({ id: plan.id, steamId64 }, 'trial expired, downgrading');
```
Evidence gate: a non-trivial branch (a business decision, an external call, a skip/`continue` in a
loop over records) with no `log.*` on the arm taken.

**Strict coverage, concrete evidence.** Apply every rule pedantically — the developer wants logs
detailed enough to debug from — but each finding still points at a specific line/branch and names
the rule it breaks; "this could log more" with no concrete pattern is noise (the shared standard's
noise filter applies). The severity tiering is what makes total coverage usable: silent swallowing
is the only 🟠 case here — everything else is 🟡 or 🔵 and informs the review without dominating the
verdict.

## §AB. Resource lifecycle — unbounded growth

Some resources grow every time the code runs but are never released or pruned. Within a single
request that's harmless — the request ends and GC reclaims it. The danger is a resource that
**outlives the request**: a process-lifetime container, a row in a table, a file on disk. Each run
adds to it, nothing removes from it, and the service slowly exhausts RAM, disk, or query
performance until it falls over. These leaks rarely show up in tests (they need time and traffic),
so review is the main place to catch them.

A leak finding needs all **three legs** — **(1) the resource outlives the request, (2) there is an
unbounded write path, (3) nothing ever removes or caps it.** If any leg is missing, it is not a
finding. State which legs you found so the developer can confirm or point at the cleanup you missed.

**In-memory accumulation (RAM):**
- No process-lifetime mutable container that only ever grows. To leak it must outlive the request —
  a module-level value, or a field on a plugin-provided **singleton** (a client, a cache). A
  `Map`/`Set`/array created *inside* a handler is request-scoped and fine.
  ```ts
  // VIOLATION — singleton field, keyed per user, never evicted
  const cache = new Map<string, string>();      // module-level, grows forever
  export const remember = (k: string, v: string) => cache.set(k, v);

  // CORRECT — bounded by construction (TTL + max size)
  const cache = new LRUCache<string, string>({ max: 10_000, ttl: 300_000 });
  ```
  Evidence gate: a module-level or singleton container with a write (`.set`, `.push`, `.add`, `+=`)
  on a per-request/per-item path and **no** matching removal (`delete`, `.pop`, `.clear`, max, TTL)
  anywhere. A memoization keyed by an unbounded space (e.g. by `id`) with no max is the same leak.

**Database rows written but never pruned (disk + query slowdown):**
- An entity written on a high-frequency path — audit/event log, outbox record, notification,
  session, one-time token, idempotency key, request trace — has a defined way to be removed: a
  retention/cleanup job, a TTL/expiry column the cleanup keys off, or an explicit delete in the flow
  (e.g. outbox rows deleted after dispatch). "Insert and move on" is the leak.
  Evidence gate: a `repo.create(...)` for a log/event/session/token-type entity on a hot path with
  no delete/retention/TTL for that entity visible in the change or referenced from it. If retention
  lives elsewhere (a cron, a partition policy), ask rather than assume it's missing — then record
  the answer.

**Files on disk never cleaned (disk):**
- A file written to a persistent location (upload staging, generated export, rendered media, scratch
  artifact) is either removed when no longer needed or covered by a retention policy. Temp files use
  a proper temp API and are deleted in a `finally`/`using`, not left to accumulate.
  Evidence gate: a write to a filesystem path on a per-request path with no corresponding cleanup and
  no retention policy for that directory.

Severity is **🟠 by default.** Escalate to **🔴** when the leak is on the request hot path and grows
fast enough to exhaust the resource in normal operation (e.g. an unbounded per-request in-memory
cache on a long-lived singleton). A genuinely low-volume path (admin-only, one row per day) can be
**🟡.**

---

## Code-quality bugs

- No empty/silent `catch {}`; catch `(err: unknown)` and narrow, or catch a specific type — never a
  bare swallow (see §AA).
- No identical branches in a ternary/`if` (copy-paste bug).
- Null/undefined checked **before** access, not after.
- No `console.*` in production code — use the injected logger.
- No `// TODO` without a tracking reference for a production concern.
- Preserve error chaining: `throw new XError({ … }, { cause: err })`.
- No `setTimeout`-as-sleep on an async path — await the real condition.
- **No `any`** — use `unknown` + narrowing, or a precise type. No `as` cast to dodge the checker.
- Exhaustive `switch` over a union ends with a `never` assertion so a new variant fails the build.

## Comments & docs

- English only. Comments explain **why**, never restate **what** the code already says.
- Public contracts (the exported service type, non-obvious helpers) carry a short doc comment.
- No commented-out code; no narration comments (`// create the appeal`).

## Imports & lint

- The toolchain is the gate: ESLint `all` + `typescript-eslint` strict-type-checked + `unicorn` +
  `import-x` + Prettier; `tsc --noEmit` typechecks. A clean lint/typecheck is required, not optional.
- `index.ts` re-exports only the module's public contract — no business logic, no internal re-exports.
- No wildcard imports of another module's internals; no unused imports.
- An `eslint-disable` carries a one-line comment justifying why it's warranted.
